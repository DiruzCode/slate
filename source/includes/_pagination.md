# Paginaci√≥n y filtros

All top-level API resources have support for bulk fetches via "list" API methods. For instance you can list charges, list customers, and list invoices. These list API methods share a common structure, taking at least these three parameters: limit, starting_after, and ending_before.
Stripe utilizes cursor-based pagination via the starting_after and ending_before parameters. Both take an existing object ID value (see below) and return objects in reverse chronological order. The ending_before parameter returns objects created before the named object. The starting_after parameter returns objects created after the named object. If both parameters are provided, only ending_before is used.
